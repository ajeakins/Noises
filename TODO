Next:
- preferences...
- settings
- proper dynamic channel numbers
- volume control
- better play, pause, stop control in audio cue dialog, elapsed/remaining times?
- refactor model, make less generic probably...
- data in elapsed/remaining.

Longer term:
- other cue types
  - Wait should be easy
  - Groups, need drag and drop and play behaviour
  - Control, hard...

Dreams:
- Audio waveform preview, great for setting start and end, auto find start/end by detecting silence?
- EQ, reverb.
