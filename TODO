Next:
- preferences...
- settings
- more saving, need to consider design for adding and removing values
- refactor model, make less generic probably...
- fades
- put application into class inheriting from QApplication?
- restructure cue list into it's own class?

Longer term:
- other cue types
  - Wait should be easy
  - Groups, need drag and drop and play behaviour
  - Control, hard...
- show mode
  - disable editing
  - giant warning on loss of focus

Dreams:
- Audio waveform preview, great for setting start and end, auto find start/end by detecting silence?
- In order of easyness... High/lowpas, EQ, reverb.
- Surround panning.
- Timing localisations.
- GUI for configuring speaker locations?
